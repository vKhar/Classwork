One such algorithm is the Huffman algorithm for text files, which will be implemented in this task.\n","\n","Unlike ASCII, which assigns a fixed size of 8 bits for each character, the Huffman algorithm assigns fewer bits to more common characters and more bits to less common characters. For example, in a long text written in English, characters such as `e` and `t` will have fewer bits assigned to them than characters such as `q` and `z`. If the text is long enough, this will use fewer bits in total to encode the text compared to ASCII.\n","\n","To know which sequence of bits to encode for each character, the **frequency** of each character, which is the number of times each character appears in the text file, is tabulated.\n","\n","The characters are put into a tree. A node is created for each character. The following steps are then repeated until there is only one node without a parent:\n","\n","1. Identify the two nodes, without parents, which have the lowest frequency.\n","2. Create a new node whose left and right children are the two nodes identified in Step 1. The frequency of the new node is the total of the frequency of its children.\n","3. Add the new node to the queue.\n","\n","The diagram on the following page shows the process of creation of a tree for a file with only five distinct characters (`A`, `E`, `I`, `O` and `U`), in five stages.\n","\n","The bit sequence assigned to a character will be the path from the root to the node corresponding to that character, where going left corresponds to `0` and going right corresponds to `1`. For example, `A` is encoded as `10` and `O` is encoded as `011`.\n","\n","### Task 59\n","Create a `Node` class that has the following attributes:\n","- `data`, which is determined when the node is initialized\n","- `left`, a pointer to another node,\n","- `right`, a pointer to another node\n","When the node is initialised, `left` and `right` do not point to anything.\n","The class also has setter methods for `left` and `right`, and getter methods for all three attributes.<div style=\"text-align: right\">[3]</div>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"SkboOq4zZgDI"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Task 59 : Jia Le\n","\n","class Node:\n","    def __init__(self,data) -> None:\n","        self.__data = data\n","        self.__left = None\n","        self.__right = None\n","    def setleft(self,left):\n","        self.__left = left\n","    def getleft(self):\n","        return self.__left\n","    def setright(self,right):\n","        self.__right = right\n","    def getright(self):\n","        return self.__right\n","    def getdata(self):\n","        return self.__data\n","    def __repr__(self) -> str:\n","        return f\"{self.__data}\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ETba-2JGZgDG"},"source":["### Task 60\n","\n","Write code that takes an `input.txt` file and creates a dictionary whose keys are the characters in the file, including spaces, punctuation and line breaks (`\\n`), and the value of a key is its frequency in the file.
