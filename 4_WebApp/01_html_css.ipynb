The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.\n","\n","> Mark-up is a term from print editing - the editor would go through the text and add annotations (i.e. this in italic, that in bold) for the printers to use when producing the final version.

Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.\n","\n","An attribute always has the form `name=\"value\"` (the attribute's identifier `name` followed by its associated value `value`). The attributes without the equals sign or a value is a shorthand for providing the empty string in HTML.\n","\n","Elements and tags are not the same things.
