The form logos and standards should be consistent with what is usually perceived as normal. For example, the submit button allows one to submit their forms, the home page icon brings the user back to the landing page and so on. The font used throughout the form should be more or less consistent. The second usability principle is affordance. It should be easy for users to know what information is needed from them for each question in the form."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nDWhEoY2CWxW"},"source":["4/4\n","### Total\n","14/14"]}],"metadata":{"interpreter":{"hash":"f4e9cda46bb2d9d7fe6ecdff0f8336a934348bf06cb492f2f42f60739b3403b4"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.6.4 64-bit","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.4"},"colab":{"name":"Task_1_OngJingJie.ipynb","provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
