<p>a) 79, 67, 21, 10, 55, 75, 84, 83, 79, 92 or 79, 84, 83, 79, 92, 67, 75, 21, 10, 55</p><p><br>b) the time complexity to find a node in the BST shown is log(n), as the sample size of where the node is decreases by about half after every loop. For example, to find 10, the first loop brings us to the left of 79, halving the sample size. The next loop bring us to the left of 67, further decreasing the sample size until it reaches 10, finding the node.</p><p><br>c) the time complexity may deteriorate when all numbers are either smaller or larger than the initial node, and we try to find the smallest or largest value respectively, as it has to loop through most, if not all the nodes to find the node we are looking for.</p><p><br>d) 55, 10, 21, 75, 67, 79, 92, 79, 83, 84</p>
