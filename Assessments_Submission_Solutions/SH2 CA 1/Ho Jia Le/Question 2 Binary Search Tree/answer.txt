<p>a) First order: [10, 21, 55, 67, 75, 79, 83, 84, 92].&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Second order: [79, 67, 21, 10, 55, 75, 84, 83, 92].</p><p>b) The time complexity to find a node in the BST shown above is O(log n). The search starts from the root node and continues down one of the two subtrees based on the value of the node being searched for. Every time the search goes down to another subtree, the number of nodes that have to be searched is cut by half.</p><p>c) Over time nodes may be removed or replaced. This may cause the BST to become unbalanced meaning one subtree becomes much larger than the other. This will deteriote the subtree to O(n) time complexity as in an unbalanced BST.</p><p>d) The post order traversal of the BST shown above is: [10, 55, 21, 75, 67, 79, 83, 92, 84, 79].</p>
