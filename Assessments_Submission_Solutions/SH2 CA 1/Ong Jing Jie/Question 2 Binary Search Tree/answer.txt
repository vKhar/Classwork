This is because the BST shown above is a balanced BST, where the number of edges between the root node and each lowest-level leaf node (the height of the tree) of the left subtree and the right subtree differs by a maximum of 1 only.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>c) If the following nodes inserted into the BST are strictly in descending order and are less than 10, this will cause the height of the left subtree to increase, and hence the height of the left subtree and the height of the right subtree will differ by more than 1. If the tree is no longer balanced, the time complexity will no longer be O(log n), and will instead be slower and approach O(n).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>d) 10, 55, 21, 75, 67, 79, 83, 92, 84, 79</p>
