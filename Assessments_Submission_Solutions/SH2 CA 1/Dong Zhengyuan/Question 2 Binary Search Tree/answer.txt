<p>a)Inorder and postOrder<br>b)It is o(n) if all nodes only have one descendent. It is o(log(n)) if the BST is balanced;where the height between the left and right subtree of each node never differs by more than 1.<br>c)As more nodes are added, there is a chance that nodes are only inserted at only one subtree (left or right), the time complexity would deteriorate to o(n).<br>d)It traverses the left subtree before traversing the right subtree and then visits the root node.</p>
