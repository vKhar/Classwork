This is because this binary search tree is balanced, where the difference of the length of any 2 branches not being more than 1. Thus, the tree would have its best case scenario of O(log n) for its time complexity.</p><p>c)<br>If values that are for example always more than 79 or always less than 79 are added, it would skew the tree such that one subtree has more values than the other, thus the time complexity would not be the ideal O(log n) anymore.</p><p>d)<br>10,55,21,75,67,79,79,83,84,92</p>
