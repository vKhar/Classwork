It does not require the data to be in any particular order. \n","\n","To find the position of a particular value involves looking at each value in turn – starting with the first – and comparing it with the search criteria. When the search criteria is met, you need to record or return its location in the collection. You must also be able to report the special case that a value has not been found. This last part only becomes apparent when the search has reached the final data item without finding the required value.\n","\n","### Example\n","\n","In this example, you have the array `[10,14,19,26,27,31,33,35,42,44]` and you are looking for the value `33` in the array.\n","\n","\n","The pseudocode for linear search function is given below.
