It consists of an ip address and a port number\n","\n","Development of application programs that makes use of these socket address to communicate is called **socket/network programming**.\n","\n","The most common type for socket applications are client-server applications, where we have a server part and a client part. As the name suggests:\n","- the server part wait for requests from the clients\n","- clients request services from the servers.\n","\n","### Server Program\n","To code an iterative server program in Python, we carry out the following in steps:\n","1. import `socket` module, \n","2. create a `socket` object, default is ipv4, tcp.  [see reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#constants)\n","3. assign an IP address and port number to the socket object using the `bind()` method. `bind()` takes in a tuple of IP address and port number `(ip,port)`. If `ip=''`, then the socket will listen from *any computer* in the network. Take note that port numbers 0 to 1023 should be avoided as they're reserved. In A-Level, you're only required to create a server program that communicates with interacts with a client program on the same computer, so `ip= '127.0.0.1'`, which refers to localhost. \n","4. Puts the socket program into passive mode by creating a queue of n incoming connections by using the listen(n), default is 128\n","5. using a while loop, we accept incoming connections to that socket using `accept()` method. `accept()` returns a tuple consisting of :\n","    - a `connection socket` object\n","    - a tuple consistent of `(ip_adress, port_number)` of the remote client.\n","6. with the `connection socket` object from part 5, we can now either:\n","    - receive message using `recv(n)` method. The parameter n is an integer indicating maximum amount of data to retrieved from the receive buffer. The operation blocks when there are no data in the buffer and returns b'' when the connection is terminated by the sender\n","    - send message using `send()` method. `send()` takes in `bytes` object as parameters, as such we need to encode the data first using `encode()` method.\n","7. process the data as needed\n","8. close the connection by using `close()` method on the connection object.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"0LEVdrHuBYta"},"outputs":[],"source":["## Echo Server, just print the message from the Client\n","\n","from socket import socket\n","\n","listen_socket = socket() ## ipv4, TCP\n","listen_socket.bind( ('127.0.0.1', 1234) )\n","print(\"Server in listen mode ...\")\n","listen_socket.listen() ## default argument\n","while True:\n","    client_socket, remote_address = listen_socket.accept() ## blocks and wait for client connection\n","    print( f\"Acception connection from {remote_address[0]}:{remote_address[1]}\")\n","    message = client_socket.recv(4096) ## max size from client is 4K\n","    message = message.decode()\n","    print(message)\n","    client_socket.send(b\"OK\")\n","    client_socket.close()\n","\n","    if message == \"bye\":\n","        break\n","listen_socket.close()\n","print(\"Closing listen socket\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0R3tcXPZBYtb"},"source":["### Client Program\n","Coding a client program in Python is very similar to making a server program, the difference is that the client program doesn't have to be constantly listening to request.
